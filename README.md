# Project Name
- Inside the Black Box: A Capstone Journey


# Project Description: 

- This project explores the final showcase for the Capstone projects of NYUAD's Interactive Media students, taking place inside the 'Black Box' located on Campus in building C3. Essentially, this project explores what it is like as a regular student to experience the wonders of the creativity that IM students have managed to pour into their projects. We introduce the user to the Capstone experience, as well as to the students who managed to create those experiences in the first place. It is a virtual experience, made with the idea that people have the option to experience the showcase through a screen, and have that experience be just as enlightening as an in-person visit.

- It is a first-person point-of-view that takes the user through the steps that a regular student in NYUAD will take in order to attend the showcase; starting from waking up in their room, going through their morning routine, to their walk towards and into the Black Box, and finally actually walking around and choosing which of the many projects on display they would like to explore first. The user is allowed to skip certain projects (the 'continue on' button) if they are not interested, or choose to actually experience the project in first person perspective. Finally, once one round was made around the room, the user is allowed to then exit or repeat the tour once again. These decisions come from our website's interactivity with the user while they are going on this journey.

- This project is a creative and innovative use of technology to showcase the Capstone projects of NYUAD's Interactive Media students in a virtual environment. The use of a first-person point-of-view provides an immersive experience for the user, making them feel like they are actually attending the showcase in person. The ability to skip certain projects or choose which ones to explore first also adds a level of interactivity to the experience, giving the user more control over their journey.

- The project also shows creativity in its approach to storytelling, taking the user through a narrative that starts with waking up in their room and going through their morning routine. This approach adds a personal touch to the experience, making it more relatable to the user and helping to create a stronger emotional connection.


# Process: 


## Video + Animation/Effects Production and Editing Process

- The first step we took to build this project was to utilize the filming equipment we had (such as the microphone and recorder) to start filming scenes in the Black Box through a first-person perspective. We had to contact some of the students whose projects were being displayed in order for us to film them explaining their projects, and then filming the scenes where the user gets to use and explore their projects. After we were done filming, we got started on the design of our website, and the editing and syncing up of all the clips and audio that we took. 

- Since our website would allow the user to go around the Black Box themselves and choose whether they want to view a project one by one, it was decided that we would have to have each project as its own individual clip so that we can build it more efficiently into our interactive webpage. This would allow for a smoother transition into the next scenes, where the user chooses to explore a project or continue walking.


# Reflection/Evaluation: 

- The initial concept of our project was to explore only one of the Capstone projects and build our theme around the idea of that specific project. 

- It was originally going to center around the owner of that project, and the process of them waking up, walking up to the Black Box, getting their project set up, and then finally displaying it and presenting it to the interested visitors. This idea was soon scrapped, as we wanted the theme of our project to center more around the general experience a regular student (or visitor) would have walking into The Black Box and exploring the projects that caught their attention. It would essentially be a virtual visit and experience of the Capstone showcase if ever someone did not get the chance to go there in person.

- In the end, our expectations were more than met, as we liked our final idea much more than the many iterations of ideas we had previously.
